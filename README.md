This project helps to solidify Flexbox knowledge covered by The Odin Project curriculum
It covers the Flexbox concepts:
- Basics
- Flex Containers And Items
- Flex Direction
- Main and Cross Axes
- Justify Content property
- Align Items Property 
- Flex Wrap
- Flex Shorthand (flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis)

Currently my not so strong areas are:
- Using the flex property
- Meaningfully aligning flex containers.
